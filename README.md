To use the app, download the directories, run the password.py file and open the local host window on the used device (most common is port 127.0.0.1): at this point, on the opened page there will be a "CREATE" button to be clicked to generate the random password. Every time the buttom is pressed a new password is visualized.

It creates a random 14 digits password composed by:
- 7 letters
- 3 capital letters
- 2 numbers
- 2 special signs


To create this app I needed:
-Flask Python library to create the .py script;
-main.css file; 
-.html files in "templates" folder downloaded from on-line examples

Some files have been entirely created by me, others downloaded from educational online materials which i later modified according to my needs.
